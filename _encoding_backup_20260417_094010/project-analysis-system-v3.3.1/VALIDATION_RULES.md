## Ã°Å¸Å½Â¯ Rule Priority Matrix

| Priority | When to Apply | Auto-Fix | Blocker |
|----------|---------------|----------|---------|
| **HIGH** | Always | If safe | Mode 3 |
| **MEDIUM** | Default mode | Sometimes | Warning only |
| **LOW** | Quality focus | Often | No |

## Ã°Å¸â€â€ž Rule Evolution

Rules are **versioned** and can be updated:

```yaml
rule_version: 1.0

updates:
  1.1:
    - "Added L-005: API versioning check"
    - "Improved Q-002: Better vague pattern detection"
  
  1.0:
    - "Initial release"
```

---

## Ã°Å¸Å¡Â¨ Emergency Override

In special cases, rules can be disabled:

```yaml
# Emergency: Disable validation
validation:
  enabled: false
  reason: "Emergency production fix"
  
# OR selective disable
validation:
  disabled_rules:
    - L-003  # Time estimate check
    - Q-004  # Readability
  reason: "Quick draft needed"
```

**Warning**: Only use in emergencies! Validation protects quality.
